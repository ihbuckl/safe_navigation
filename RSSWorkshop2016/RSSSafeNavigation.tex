\begin{abstract}
With the growth of domestic robot industry, it is important to understand the navigation of mobile robots in dynamic environments. Use of mobile robots in the home can greatly improve the quality of life and is a growing field of research. With an increased interaction between humans and robots, and an increasingly shared workspace, it is important to study the safety of the robotic system and the extent of guarantees that can be made to minimize risk of injury. We present a nonlinear control approach to the navigation problem that achieves the objective of reaching pre-defined locations with provable guarantees of safety. Verification of the controller is performed first in MATLAB simulation, which shows that the controller is capable of driving the system to a pre-defined location while maintaining all required safety rules defined in it's environment. The system is implemented on a Segway RMP 200 based robot, demonstrating that the nonlinear navigation controller successfully traverses the gap between theory and practice.

\section{Introduction}
Safety is an important concern for mobile robots working in collaborative environments. Typical robotic systems separately deal with safety and task completion in a hierarchical fashion--a high level controller decides which control law to use based on the situation. Navigation is of fundamental concern for mobile robots. The ability to successfully avoid obstacles, both static and dynamic, while moving towards a goal location largely determines the utility of a mobile robotic platform. It is critical that robots avoid obstacles for their own safety as well as the safety of the people around them. We use the navigation problem to motivate the direct addition of safety into the controller for the robot.

After formulating the navigation control strategy, MATLAB simulation is used to verify that the navigation control strategy correctly drives the state of the robot to a target. After demonstrating that the robot successfully navigates to a target location, a trajectory is generated for a map using a probabilistic roadmap, and the navigation control strategy is used to drive the robot along the trajectory. After thoroughly substantiating the efficacy of the navigation control strategy in simulation, the controller is implemented in the ROS framework and evaluated on a Segway RMP 200 based mobile robot, verifying the navigation control strategy in a real world scenario.

\section{Approach}
Control Lyapunov functions and control barrier functions are formulated to individually accomplish the objectives of navigation and obstacle avoidance. As in \cite{amesACC} and \cite{ames2014esclf}, the control Lyapunov and barrier functions are soft and hard constrained in a Quadratic Programming based controller to achieve safe navigation. Figure~\ref{fig:obs} shows the egocentric coordinate system of the robot and describes the variables used in the polar form of the unicycle dynamics modelling the robot, given by: 
\begin{equation}
\left(
\begin{matrix}
\dot{r}\\
\dot{\theta}\\
\end{matrix}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{matrix}
- v \text{ cos}(\delta)\\
\frac{v}{r} \text{ sin}(\delta)\\
\end{matrix}
\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\dot{\delta}=\frac{v}{r} \text{ sin}(\delta)+\omega.
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{The egocentric co-ordinate system of the robot is shown above. $r$ is the radial distance of the robot from the origin, $\phi$ is the heading of the robot in the target frame, $\theta$ is the orientation of the target frame in the robot frame, and $\delta$ is  the egocentric heading. $z_b$ is the vector joining the center of the robot to the obstacle,  $r_b$ is the minimum safe distance from the obstacle, and $\beta$ is the angle between the global $x$-axis and $z_b$. \label{fig:obs}} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Control Lyapunov Functions}
To design the navigation control law, two control Lyapunov functions are formulated. The standard quadratic Lyapunov function candidate is first considered:
\begin{equation}
V_1=\frac{1}{2}(r^2+\theta^2)=-r v \text{ cos}(\delta) + \theta v \text{ sin}(\delta)\label{v1}
\end{equation}
%\begin{align}
%V_1&=\frac{1}{2}(r^2+\theta^2)\label{v1}\\
%&=-r v \text{ cos}(\delta) + \theta v \text{ sin}(\delta)
%\end{align}
Fixing $\delta = \text{arctan}(-k_1\theta)$ to enforce a virtual steering control as in \cite{park2011}, the derivative of the Lyapunov function becomes:
\begin{equation}
\dot{V_1}=-r v \text{ cos}(\text{arctan}(-k_1\theta)) + \theta v \text{ sin}(\text{arctan}(-k_1\theta)).
\end{equation} 

Because $\theta\in (-\pi,\pi]$, $v>0$, and $r\geq 0$ , $\dot{V}<0$ $\forall \theta$, $r\neq0$; thus, the steering control asymptotically drives $r,\theta\to 0$. By choosing $v=k_3 r$ in some neighborhood of $r=0$ for positive constant $k_3,$ the singularity at $r=0$ is removed and the system is globally asymptotically stable.  
%Furthermore, the virtual steering control simultaneously drives the robot to the final position while aligning its heading with the positive global $x$-axis. 

To drive the state to zero through the steering control, the heading must be driven such that $\delta = \text{arctan}(-k_1\theta).$ An objective $z_1$ is defined: 
\begin{equation}
z_1 \equiv \delta - \text{arctan}(-k_1\theta).
\label{z1}
\end{equation} The derivative is calculated to yield:
\begin{equation}
\dot{z_1}=\left( 1+\frac{k_1}{1+(k_1\theta)^2}\right) \frac{v}{r}\text{ sin}(z_1+\text{ arctan}(-k_1\theta))+\omega.
\end{equation}
Feedback linearization can be used to achieve this objective by choosing the angular velocity 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\omega = -\frac{v}{r}\left[ k_2 z_1+\left( 1 + \frac{k_1}{1+(k_1\theta)^2} \right)\right.\\
\left. \vphantom{\frac{v}{r}} \text{sin}(z_1+\text{ arctan}(-k_1\theta))\right],
\end{split}
\end{equation}
the objective dynamics are globally exponentially stable with the following form: $\dot{z_1}=-k_2(v/r)z_1,$ where $k_1$ and $k_2$ can be chosen to increase or decrease how aggressive the steering control is.

A second steering controller is designed to drive the state away from the origin and is defined by the following objective: \begin{equation}z_2=\delta-\text{ atan}(k_1\beta).\label{z2}\end{equation}
The derivative of $z_2$ is similarly computed as with $z_1$, and is given by $\dot{z_2} = \dot{\delta}.$ The steering objectives are modelled along with other constraints by defining: 
\begin{equation} V_2 = \frac{1}{2}  z_*^2, \label{v2}\end{equation}
where $z_*$ represents the objectives $z_1$ and $z_2$ in \eqref{z1} and \eqref{z2}.

Feedback linearization can be used to show that steering control is achieved; thus, there exist control inputs that satisfy the control Lyapunov function $\dot{V_2}<0$; furthermore, following Definition 3 in \cite{ames2014esclf}, a control Lyapunov function is exponentially stabilizing if it satisfies
\begin{equation}
\inf_{u\in U}\left[ \dot{V}+\gamma V \right] \leq 0
\label{eq:esclf}
\end{equation}
for some constant $\gamma >0$, so choosing the correct inputs $u$ will achieve the desired exponential stabilization. 

%According to \cite{amesACC}, by picking a soft constraint relaxation variable $\lambda$, the condition for exponential stabilization shown in \eqref{eq:esclf} is relaxed and can be enforced simultaneously along with a single hard constraint. Because control of the robotic system requires either $\dot{z_1}=-k_2\frac{v}{r}z_1$ or $\dot{z_2}=-k_2\frac{v}{r}z_2$ and $\dot{V}<0$, two soft constrained expressions must be satisfied at a time to achieve exponential stabilization of the state to zero.

\subsection{Control Barrier Functions}
Two control barrier functions are formulated to keep the robot in the safe set $C$ defined by:
\begin{align}
C &= \left\lbrace x \in \mathbb{R}^3 | z_b\geq r_b\right\rbrace\\
\partial C &= \left\lbrace x \in \mathbb{R}^3 | z_b=r_b\right\rbrace\\
\text{Int}(C) &= \left\lbrace x \in \mathbb{R}^3 | z_b > r_b\right\rbrace.
\end{align}

As presented in \cite{ames2015robust}, a barrier function is a zeroing barrier function $h(x)$ if $\dot{h}(x)\leq \gamma h(x).$ For the purpose of avoiding obstacles in the event that the robot leaves the safe set, a zeroing barrier function was chosen with the following form:
\begin{equation}
h(x)=\sqrt{(-v\text{ cos}(\theta)-b_x)^2+(v\text{ sin}(\theta)-b_y)^2}.
\end{equation}
The derivative of $h(x)$ is given by the following expression:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\dot{h}(x)=\frac{1}{h(x)} \left[ (-v\text{ cos}(\delta)(r-b_y\text{ sin}(\theta)+b_x\text{ cos}(\theta)) \right. \\
\left. \vphantom{\frac{1}{h(x)}}-v\text{ sin}(\delta)(b_x\text{ sin}(\theta)+b_y\text{ cos}(\theta))\right]
\end{split}
\label{zbf}
\end{equation}

A second barrier function was chosen to prevent the robot from leaving the safe set. According to Definition 2 in \cite{amesACC}, the barrier function $B$ is a control barrier function if 
\begin{equation}
\inf_{u\in U}\left[ \dot{B}+\frac{\gamma}{B} \right] \leq 0.
\label{eq:cbf}
\end{equation}
Thus, by satisfying the equation $\dot{B}\leq 1/B$, the barrier function will prevent the robot from leaving the safe set. The barrier function was chosen to be
\begin{equation}
B=\frac{1}{h(x)-z_{safe}},
\label{bf}
\end{equation}
and its derivative is given by
\begin{equation}
\dot{B}=\frac{-\dot{h}(x)}{(h(x)-z_{safe})^2}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{QP Based Controller}
Quadratic programming is used to find control inputs that simultaneously satisfy both the soft and hard constraints of the system. To minimize control inputs, the cost function $\textbf{u}^TH\textbf{u}+F^T\textbf{u}$ is chosen. The QP is given by the following expression:
\begin{equation}
u^*(x,z) = \argmin_{\textbf{u}=
\left[\begin{matrix}
v\\
\omega\\
\lambda_1\\
\lambda_2\\
\alpha_1\\
\alpha_2
\end{matrix}\right]
\in \mathbb{R}^6}
\frac{1}{2}\textbf{u}^TH\textbf{u}+F^T\textbf{u} 
\label{QP}
\end{equation}
\begin{align}
\text{ s.t.\hspace{1cm}}
\dot{V_1} -\alpha_1 V_1 & \leq\lambda_1\\
\dot{V_2} -\alpha_2 V_2 & \leq\lambda_2\\
\dot{h(x)}-\alpha_1 h(x) & \leq \lambda_1\\
\dot{B} & \leq \gamma/B\\
c_a \leq v & \leq c_b\\
c_c\leq \omega & \leq c_d\\
\alpha_1,\alpha_2 & \leq 0
\end{align}

In \eqref{QP}, the sparse matrix $H\in \mathbb{R}^{6\times 6}$ has 1 in the first four elements of the diagonal, and the last two elements of the sparse vector $F^T\in \mathbb{R}^{1\times 6}$ are 10 and 1. The last two elements in the diagonal of $H$ were chosen to be zero to ensure that the negative quadratic cost of the variables $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ is as large as possible. Conversely, the last two elements of $F^T$ were chosen to ensure that $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ were negative to minimize the cost. The slack variables $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are used to create soft constraints on the control Lyapunov functions and the zeroing control barrier function.

The control Lyapunov functions $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the Lyapunov functions corresponding to the objectives of driving the state to zero and enforcing the steering control respectively; the equations are given by \eqref{v1} and \eqref{v2}. Because there are two steering objectives, $z_1$ in \eqref{z1} and $z_2$ in \eqref{z2}, for $V_2$, two QP control laws are required: one which drives the state towards the target while avoiding obstacles, and the other that drives the state in such a way that the robot steers away from obstacles. Toggling between steering objectives is dependent on the obstacle measurement. If the robot is not in $C$ (e.g. $z_b\leq r_b$), then the steering objective $z_2$ is used. Otherwise, $z_1$ is used, and $\alpha_1=0$ is additionally enforced. $h(x)$ and $B$ in the QP controller are given in equations \eqref{zbf} and \eqref{bf}. 

\section{Results}
MATLAB simulation was used to verify that the navigation control strategy using the QP controller enabled the robot to navigate to the desired position while avoiding obstacles. Figure~\ref{fig:octoplot} shows that the navigation control strategy is capable of driving the robot to the final position while avoiding obstacles from a variety of starting locations. Figure~\ref{fig:prm_works} shows that the navigation control strategy enables safe navigation between target waypoints generated through a probabilistic roadmap.

Implementing the navigation control law in the ROS framework, Gazebo simulation, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gazebo}, was used to corroborate the results of the MATLAB simulation. Following success in Gazebo, robot experiments were performed on the Segway robot ``Jeeves''. The Hokuyo laser scans are subscribed to and the appropriate processing is performed. The robot is commanded to drive to a set point and the optimal $u$ is computed at every time step. The dynamics is propogated forward using the odometry. To add the obstacle, a human moved into the operation range of the obstacle as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:jeeves_exp} and ensured that the robot did not break any safety constraints. A video showing one experimental run can be seen at \url {https://youtu.be/uhTiYyZxtfc}. The video shows that the robot maintains its safe distance from the human and tries to avoid the human, when the human walks out of the radius of influence the robot is free to move at greater speeds again.

\section{Conclusion}
We show that the nonlinear controller is generatlizable to multiple robots and is provably safe. The theoretical analysis shows that the controller stabilizes the system while obeying the ``safety'' rules. The exaperimental analysis shows that the system can be implemented on a real world system and the results are consistent with the claims. The developed system is almost self-contained and does not require many parameter adjustments. 
For future work, we propose more complex modelling of the obstacles to better capture the nature of the obstacle. For example, the safety barrier around a human is different from that around a wall. It is more ``socially'' acceptable to drive close to a wall but not as acceptable to be that close to a human.
